I named my Chat UI as Chit-Chat.
I used the following technologies: React, Node, and Socket.io.

I used Webstorm IDE for the project.
In terminal, these commands are needed for this project:

npm install http
npm install --save-dev http
npm install --save-dev express
npm install --save-dev socket.io
node server

--save-dev is for the .json file.
